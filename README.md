3 About

The Project astro for sei-52 came with the idea of creating a Zodiac plataform where people could be conected by matching star signs.
For my point of  view the crud app is perfect to make the profiles to match by using the db seed and models for assossiations.
I made this app as per my knowledge inf the astrology industry, it worths a lot of money, so I might get lucky with some rich people reaching me  out to buy my app and my hidden ideas that I havent applied to my app yet, just to protect my business.


# Features
