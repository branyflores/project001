# Astro - Project

-------------------------

Project Description
======================
initially my idea for the Astro project would be to create a dating app, to connect people through their star signs, based on mine personal, also people's current interest in Astrology and how this industry has grown.

- As this was my first project using a CRUD system, I found out throughout the creation of the project's fetured, that working with dates of birth and making them to match, would be a challenge far beyond my knowledge in Ruby language.
Therefore, I followed the instructions of my advisors, who guided me to create an initial platform where users can register and create a profile with Name, Photo and a start sign that contains also an element.

======================

### Tech Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap


Design
====================
For the Design of this Project, i went deeper in learning about Css, which took me across the Css libraries. 
I've chosen Bootstrap, which gave me a hand with styling the login FORMS, anf the cards displayed in the Home page.

I'm very proud to say that, the website's color chart was entirely chosen by me, which brought lightness and identity to my App.

=====================

## Basic fetures 

- Create profile
- Login
- Logout
- Access to your Horoscope Card based on your Star Sign
