# Astro - Project

-------------------------

Project Description
======================
initially my idea for the Astro project would be to create a dating app, to connect people through their star signs, based on mine personal, also people's current interest in Astrology and how this industry has grown.

- As this was my first project using a CRUD system, I found out throughout the creation of the project's fetured, that working with dates of birth and making them to match, would be a challenge far beyond my knowledge in Ruby language.
Therefore, I followed the instructions of my advisors, who guided me to create an initial platform where users can register and create a profile with Name, Photo and a start sign that contains also an element.

======================

### Tech Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
 
=====================

## Basic fetures 

- Create profile
- Login
- Logout
- Access to your Horoscope Card baes on your Star Sign
